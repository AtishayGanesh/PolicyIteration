# Policy Iteration
EE5121 - Convex Optimization, Term Paper Code.  
There are two folders - part a and part b.  
The code in each folder solve the two variants of the problem mentioned in the term paper.  
To run the code, just open Matlab to the corresponding folder and run the "value.m" matlab file.  
The graphs of the optimal policy will be displayed once the code is finished running.
